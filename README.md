# satseer
Orbit predictor tools that generate kml files to use for operational planning.

It's really bare bones right now. You should be able to copy paste into a notebook or your python script runner of choice and push "run". 

Updates coming soon(TM): 
- Putting this in a Jupyter Notebok
- Set up a dictionary for different sensors on the satellites for more automated footprint widths
